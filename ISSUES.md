- ✅ JSON responses properly formatted
- ✅ External URL accessible from internet
- ✅ GitHub repository created and code pushed

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Server running on port 3000
- ✅ External URL: https://backend-morphvm-j9mt3es5.http.cloud.morph.so
- ✅ Database: Neon PostgreSQL (fragrant-snow-64023458)

All requirements for Step 1 have been successfully met:
- ✅ Backend built with Node.js/Express
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL database integrated
- ✅ All endpoints working correctly
- ✅ Backend exposed externally and accessible
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Comprehensive testing completed
